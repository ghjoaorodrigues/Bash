# Bash Learning Journey

> A personal journey through learning and mastering the Bash shell.

---

## Background

I started learning Bash during the first week of the 42 Piscine with Shell00 and Shell01. These projects gave me my first exposure to command-line tools, scripting, redirections, and file permissions.

As I advanced, Bash became essential to my workflow — especially while working on Minishell, where I implemented a shell in C and had to understand Bash behavior deeply. Born2beroot also reinforced this by requiring Bash automation for system setup and user management.

This repository logs what I’ve learned and serves as a personal reference.
