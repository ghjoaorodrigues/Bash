# Bash Learning Journey

> A personal journey through learning and mastering the Bash shell.

## How I Got Here

I was introduced to Bash during the first week of the 42 Piscine. At the time, I had almost no understanding of the shell, but working on the Shell00 and Shell01 projects gave me my first taste of command-line power: learning basic commands, file manipulation, permissions, scripting, and redirections.

As I progressed through the 42 curriculum, Bash became a natural part of my workflow—whether for automating things with simple scripts or understanding how terminals process commands. That foundation became even more important when I started working on **Minishell**, a C-based project where we build our own shell from scratch. Even though it's written in C, Minishell deepened my understanding of how Bash works under the hood: parsing, redirections, pipes, subshells, environment variables, and signal handling.

This repository documents what I’ve learned, and serves both as a log of progress and a reference I can revisit.
